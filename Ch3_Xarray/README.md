Xarray (Description by @jsimkins2)

Xarray is an open source project and Python package that makes working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays simple, efficient, and fun!

Xarray introduces labels in the form of dimensions, coordinates and attributes on top of raw NumPy-like arrays, which allows for a more intuitive, more concise, and less error-prone developer experience. The package includes a large and growing library of domain-agnostic functions for advanced analytics and visualization with these data structures.

Xarray was inspired by and borrows heavily from pandas, the popular data analysis package focused on labelled tabular data. It is particularly tailored to working with netCDF files, which were the source of xarrayâ€™s data model, and integrates tightly with dask for parallel computing.
